## Project Summary  

This project analyzes real guest interactions at a Thai restaurant to understand why some guests accept upsell offers — especially our signature Chiang Mai Beer — and how these choices influence their intention to return.

It blends my hands-on experience as a server with analytical work in Excel, Power BI, and Python to reveal patterns that are often felt during service but rarely measured.

The goal is simple:  
Transform everyday service moments into measurable insights that guide branding, sales strategy, staffing, and guest experience.

## How the Story Begins  

While working on the dining floor, I noticed that a single interaction could transform the guest experience:

- A warm recommendation  
- A cultural story  
- A shared moment  
- A signature item like Chiang Mai Beer

Some guests said yes immediately.  
Some hesitated.  
Some returned weeks later asking,  
"Do you still have that Chiang Mai Beer you recommended last time?"

I wanted to understand the pattern behind these behaviors.  
Analytics provided the answers.

# Key Insights  

### 1. Chiang Mai Beer Upsell Success Rate – 61.29%  
More than half of all guests accepted the signature beer recommendation.  
This is unusually strong for a specialty beverage upsell and shows high openness to brand-forward suggestions.

---

### 2. Upsell Acceptance Strongly Predicts Return Intent  
Guests who accepted Chiang Mai Beer were far more likely to say Yes to returning.  
Accepting the beer is not just a purchase — it creates brand memory and strengthens loyalty.

---

### 3. Groups and Solo Diners Are the Most Persuadable Segments  
- Groups (78%): Influence each other, enjoy sharing new experiences  
- Solo diners (77%): Curious and open to conversation  
- Couples (48%): Prefer subtle, experience-based recommendations

Different guest types require different upsell strategies.

---

### 4. Early Evening (5–7 PM) Is the Golden Window  
- 5–6 PM: 72.7% acceptance  
- 6–7 PM: 55.7% acceptance  

Guests are relaxed and open during these hours, making them ideal for storytelling and introducing the signature beer.

---

### 5. Upsells Improve Hospitality, Not Just Sales  
A “yes” creates connection, builds trust, and becomes part of the guest’s emotional memory of the restaurant.

Guests don’t respond only to what you offer — they respond to how, when, and why you offer it.

A meaningful recommendation like Chiang Mai Beer:

- Enhances the experience  
- Creates brand memory  
- Drives repeat visits  
- Strengthens the connection between guest and restaurant  

This project bridges service intuition with analytical evidence, turning insights into operational strategy and business value.
