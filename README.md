# Chiang Mai Thai Dining – Upsell & Return Intent Analysis
1. Introduction

This project examines how different types of guests respond to upsell offers at a Thai restaurant, and how this behavior connects to their intention to return.
It brings together two perspectives:

My experience working directly with guests as a server

My training in analytics, using Power BI, DAX, and Python

By combining these viewpoints, the analysis creates a clear story of why guests behave the way they do — and how the restaurant can use these insights to improve revenue and guest satisfaction.


2. What This Data Represents

The dataset includes:

Guest types (Solo, Couple, Group)

Time blocks (5–6 PM, 6–7 PM, Other)

Whether a beer upsell was offered

Whether the guest accepted

Whether the guest expressed Return Intent (“Yes”, “Maybe”, “No”)

These variables allow us to understand who accepts upsells, when they accept, and how it affects their likelihood of returning.


3. Key Patterns Observed
3.1 Upselling and Return Intent Move Together

While serving, I often noticed that small positive interactions — such as offering a drink or making a recommendation — made guests more engaged and satisfied.

The data supported this:

Guests who accepted an upsell showed the highest rate of “Yes” for Return Intent.

Guests who rejected offers were more likely to say “Maybe” or “No.”

This suggests that upselling is not only a sales technique but also a relationship-building moment.

3.2 5–7 PM Is the Most Responsive Window

From experience, this is when guests are relaxed, attentive, and open to suggestions.
The analysis confirmed this:

5–6 PM showed the strongest upsell rate

6–7 PM closely followed

“Other” times were significantly lower

Early evening provides the best opportunity for staff to offer additional items confidently.

3.3 Group Diners Respond the Most

In real service situations, groups tend to be enthusiastic and collaborative.
They discuss menu items aloud, share tasting ideas, and often go along with a recommendation if one person agrees.

The data clearly showed:

Groups had the highest upsell success rate

Groups also showed the highest return intent

Group guests present a high-value opportunity for revenue and loyalty.

3.4 Couples Are More Selective

Couples usually prefer a quieter, more personalized dining experience.
They are less receptive to frequent suggestions.

The analysis confirmed this:

Couples had the lowest upsell acceptance

Their return intent was steady but not as strong as groups

This indicates couples need a different approach — something subtle and experience-focused.


4. What These Insights Mean for the Restaurant

Pulling the patterns together, here is the story the data tells:

Upselling creates stronger guest relationships.
The interaction itself often leads to a better experience.

Timing matters.
Staff should focus upsell efforts during early evening hours when guest openness is highest.

Different guests require different strategies.

Groups → shared items, samplers, pitchers

Couples → pairings, signature cocktails, dessert enhancements

Solos → personalized recommendations

Return intent improves when guests feel engaged.
Staff training can reinforce confidence and communication techniques.

7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how analytics can bring clarity to everyday restaurant operations.
By connecting frontline experience with data, the story becomes clear:

When upsells work, guests feel more cared for.

When the timing is right, upsells are natural.

When recommendations match the guest type, satisfaction rises.

This study shows the value of combining service experience with analytical skills — turning daily observations into insights that support business decisions, staff development, and guest retention.
