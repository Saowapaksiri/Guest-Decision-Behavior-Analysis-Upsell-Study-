# Project Summary 

This project analyzes real guest interactions at a Thai restaurant to understand why some guests accept upsell offers and why some return.
It blends my experience as a server with analytical work using Power BI and Python to reveal patterns that are often felt during service but rarely measured.

How the Story Begins

Working on the dining floor, I often noticed small moments that changed how guests behaved.
A friendly upsell.
A recommendation.
A quick conversation.

These interactions seemed to affect whether they enjoyed the experience — and whether they might come back.

-------------------------------------------------------------

# What the Data Revealed
1. Upsells weren’t just “extra sales” — they changed how guests felt.

Guests who accepted an upsell were the most likely to say they would return.
Those who declined were far more uncertain.


# This confirmed a feeling I had as a server:
When a guest says “yes” to your recommendation, they’re not just buying an item —
they’re connecting with you. That connection becomes part of their experience.


2. Early evening (5–7 PM) is when guests are most open to suggestions.

- I always felt guests were friendlier and more relaxed in this window.
The data proved it:

- Highest upsell acceptance at 5–6 PM

- Strong performance at 6–7 PM

- Much lower acceptance during other hours

- This is the ideal time for staff to share recommendations with confidence.


3. Groups respond the best — and return the most.

Groups tend to laugh together, discuss dishes, and follow along when someone agrees to an upsell.

- Highest upsell rate

- Strongest return intent

- Groups are the most influential segment for increasing sales and loyalty.


4. Couples are more selective — and need a different approach.

Couples often prefer a smooth, quiet experience.
They rarely respond to generic upsells.

-------------------------------------------------------------

# The data matched what I observed:

- Lowest upsell acceptance

- Moderate return intent

- They engage better with subtle, experience-based recommendations
(wine pairings, desserts, signature drinks).


# The story the data tells is clear:

- Not every guest wants the same type of upsell.

- Timing matters as much as the offer.

- Positive interaction improves both sales and loyalty.

- Staff communication directly shapes guest experience.


  This project turns everyday service moments into structured insights that can guide training, staffing, and menu strategy.

# Final Insight

Data confirmed what service experience hinted:
Guests don’t just respond to what you offer — they respond to how and when you offer it.
Understanding this blend of behavior and timing creates opportunities to improve both revenue and hospitality.
