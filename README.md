## Project Summary

This project analyzes real guest interactions at a Thai restaurant to understand why some guests accept upsell offers — especially our signature Chiang Mai Beer — and how these decisions influence their intention to return.

The analysis blends my hands-on experience as a server with work in Excel, Power BI, and Python. It reveals behavioral patterns that are commonly felt during service but rarely measured, turning intuitive observations into data-driven insights.

The goal of this project is to transform everyday service interactions into actionable insights that support menu design, brand positioning, staff training, and overall guest experience improvements.

## How the Story Begins

While working on the dining floor, I noticed how a single interaction could transform a guest’s experience:

- A thoughtful recommendation  
- A cultural explanation  
- A shared moment at the table  
- A signature item like Chiang Mai Beer  

Some guests immediately said yes.  
Some hesitated.  
Some returned weeks later asking,  
“Do you still have that Chiang Mai beer you recommended last time?”

These patterns led me to ask deeper questions. This project uses analytics to uncover the why behind guest decisions and how those choices connect to long-term loyalty.

# Key Insights

### 1. Strong Upsell Performance  
The Chiang Mai Beer upsell success rate was 61.29%, meaning the majority of guests responded positively to the recommendation. This is exceptional for a specialty beverage item.

### 2. Upsell Acceptance Predicts Return Intent  
Guests who accepted Chiang Mai Beer were significantly more likely to say they would return. The upsell acted as a brand touchpoint that strengthened emotional memory and loyalty.

### 3. Guest Type Influences Behavior  
- Groups (78%) were the most willing to try the beer and showed the strongest return intent.  
- Solo diners (77%) were highly open to conversation and recommendations.  
- Couples (48%) responded better to subtle, experience-based suggestions rather than direct upsells.

Different segments require different selling styles.

### 4. Early Evening Is the Ideal Upsell Window  
Acceptance rates were highest between 5–6 PM (72.7%) and strong between 6–7 PM (55.7%).  
Guests were more relaxed, receptive, and willing to try something new during this period.

### 5. Upselling Enhances Hospitality  
Upselling, when done with intention, improved the guest experience rather than interrupting it. A “yes” to a recommendation became a moment of connection that stayed with the guest.

# Final Insight

Data confirmed what service experience had always suggested: guests do not respond only to what you offer — they respond to how, when, and why you offer it.

A recommendation like Chiang Mai Beer does more than increase revenue.  
It strengthens the guest experience, builds brand memory, and increases the likelihood of a return visit.

This project bridges hospitality intuition with analytical evidence, turning real guest behavior into strategic, measurable insights for restaurant management.
