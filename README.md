## Project Summary

This project analyzes real guest interactions at a Thai restaurant to understand why some guests accept upsell offers — especially our signature Chiang Mai Beer — and how these decisions influence their intention to return.

The analysis blends my hands-on experience as a server with work in Excel, Power BI, and Python. It reveals behavioral patterns that are commonly felt during service but rarely measured, turning intuitive observations into data-driven insights.

The goal of this project is to transform everyday service interactions into actionable insights that support menu design, brand positioning, staff training, and overall guest experience improvements.

## How the Story Begins

While working on the dining floor, I noticed how a single interaction could transform a guest’s experience:

- A thoughtful recommendation  
- A cultural explanation  
- A shared moment at the table  
- A signature item like Chiang Mai Beer  

Some guests immediately said yes.  
Some hesitated.  
Some returned weeks later asking,  
“Do you still have that Chiang Mai beer you recommended last time?”

These patterns led me to ask deeper questions. This project uses analytics to uncover the why behind guest decisions and how those choices connect to long-term loyalty.
