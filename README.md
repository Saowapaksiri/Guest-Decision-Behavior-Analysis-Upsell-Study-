# Guest-Decision-Behavior-Analysis-Upsell-Study-
Analytics Portfolio

-------------------------------------------------------------

Project Summary 

This project analyzes real guest interactions at a Thai restaurant to understand why some guests accept upsell offers — especially our signature Chiang Mai Beer — and how these choices connect to their intention to return. It blends my experience working directly with guests on the dining floor with analytical work in Excel, Power BI, and Python.

# The goal is simple
Turn everyday service moments into measurable insights that help build revenue, brand memory, and guest loyalty.

# How the Story Begins

While serving tables, I often noticed how a single interaction could change the entire dining experience. A warm greeting. A recommendation. A shared laugh. A well-timed upsell.

Some guests said yes immediately.
Some hesitated.
Some returned weeks later asking for “that Chiang Mai beer you recommended last time.”

These moments felt meaningful — but I wanted to understand why they happened
and how they shaped guest behavior.

# What the Data Revealed
Chiang Mai Beer Upsells Build Brand Memory

Upsells were not just “extra sales.”
The guests who accepted Chiang Mai Beer were also the most likely to say they would return.

This matches what I saw during service:
When a guest says “yes” to your signature recommendation, they aren’t just buying a drink —
they’re connecting with the brand and with you as their server.

A unique item like Chiang Mai Beer becomes part of their memory of the restaurant,
and that memory increases loyalty.

# Early Evening (5–7 PM) Is the Golden Window

Guests during 5–7 PM were the most relaxed, open, and social — something I noticed long before analyzing the data.

The numbers confirmed it:

Highest Chiang Mai Beer acceptance at 5–6 PM

Strong performance at 6–7 PM

Much lower acceptance outside this window

This is the best time for staff to share recommendations confidently and naturally.

--------------------------------------------------------------

# Groups Respond the Best — and Return the Most

Groups have the highest

- Upsell acceptance

- Chiang Mai Beer interest

- Return intent

- They influence each other and create shared excitement around trying something new.

- Groups are a key segment for increasing both sales and brand loyalty.

--------------------------------------------------------------

# Couples Are More Selective — and Require a Softer Approach

Couples tend to prefer a smoother, more private dining experience.
They respond less to generic upsells but are more open to:

- Culturally meaningful recommendations

- Staff storytelling (“This beer comes from Chiang Mai…”)

- Items that elevate the dining experience

# This aligns with the data showing:

- Lowest upsell rate

- Moderate return intent

- They require a gentle, personalized pitch, not a direct upsell.

--------------------------------------------------------------

# The Story the Data Tells
- Not every guest responds to upsells the same way

# Guest type influences both acceptance and return behavior.

- Timing is just as important as the offer
  

# The difference between 5 PM and 9 PM is a completely different customer mindset.

- Signature items (like Chiang Mai Beer) strengthen brand memory
  

# A unique upsell creates emotional recall — and loyalty.

- Staff communication directly shapes revenue and repeat visits
  A simple recommendation, when delivered with intention, becomes a measurable business impact.

# Final Insight

Data confirmed what service experience hinted:
Guests don’t respond only to what you offer — they respond to how, when, and why you offer it.

A thoughtful recommendation like Chiang Mai Beer creates a moment of connection that improves the guest experience, increases revenue, and strengthens the restaurant’s brand identity.
