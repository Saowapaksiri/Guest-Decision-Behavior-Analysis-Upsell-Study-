# Chiang Mai Thai Dining – Upsell & Return Intent Analysis

This Power BI project analyzes upsell performance and customer return intent for a Thai restaurant, using DAX measures and interactive visuals.

## Key KPIs

- **Upsell Success Rate:** 61.29%
- **Accepted Upsells:** 76 out of 124 guest interactions
- **Return Intent – Yes %:** 43%

## Main Insights

1. **Upselling increases loyalty** – guests who accepted upsells showed a much higher tendency to select "Yes" for Return Intent compared to those who declined.
2. **Best upsell window is 5–7 PM** – early dinner time blocks have the highest upsell success, while “Other” hours underperform.
3. **Group diners are the most responsive** – groups show the highest upsell rate and the strongest return intent, while couples respond less to upsell offers.
4. **Actionable opportunities** – focus training and promotions on 5–7 PM and group tables, and improve the experience for couples to increase repeat visits.
